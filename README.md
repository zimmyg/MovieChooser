# MovieChooser

This is a little project I made to solve a problem I always have - not being able to choose a movie to watch.
The software will show a random choice from your files, and you'll have the option to skip if you don't want to watch, or hit play and automatically start the video you've chosen.

Planned Additions
------------------
- CONFIG ( Being able to setup where your files live, rather than have them hardcoded like now. )
- EXTRA LOCATIONS ( Being able to have multiple locations that can be pulled from and being able to toggle them, right now its just one. )
  - This includes the ability to choose from TV shows, audiobooks, etc.
