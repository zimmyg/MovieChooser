# MovieChooser

This is a little project I made to solve a problem I always have - not being able to choose a movie to watch.
The software will show a random choice from your files, and you'll have the option to skip if you don't want to watch, or hit play and automatically start the video you've chosen.

Planned Additions
------------------
- Maybe add the ability to toggle your sources, so if you only want tv shows, or only movies, etc.
- More robust code! Right now the code is rather fragile and will crash if just about anything is wrong (especially with the config system), so I'll be aiming to clean up and recover from errors.
